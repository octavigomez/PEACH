# PEACH-Paleoseismic-EArthquake-CHronologies

# This code is designed to compute paleoearthquake chronologies from paleoseismic data. Read the user manual in the main folder for details on
# how to run the code. The folder structure shown in the repository should not be changed.

# The principal code (PEACH.m) uses three scripts written by users external to this project that they shared freely in the MATLAB Central File Exchange.
# We provide them in the main folder of the repository as they are required for the code to work. The references to these scripts are:
