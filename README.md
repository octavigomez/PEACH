# PEACH-Paleoseismic-EArthquake-CHronologies

This code is designed to compute paleoearthquake chronologies from paleoseismic data, including site chronologies previously modelled with OxCal. 

This work is part of a paper published in Geoscientific Model Development called "Deciphering past earthquakes from the probabilistic modeling of paleoseismic records – the Paleoseismic EArthquake CHronologies code (PEACH, version 1)".

Authors: Octavi Gómez-Novell, Bruno Pace, Francesco Visini, Joanna Faure Walker and Oona Scotti.



The user manual in the main folder contains details of the approach and guide on how to run the code. The folder structure shown in the repository should not be changed.
