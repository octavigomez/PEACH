# PEACH-Paleoseismic-EArthquake-CHronologies

This code is designed to compute paleoearthquake chronologies from paleoseismic data, including site chronologies previously modelled with OxCal. 

This work is part of a paper submitted to Earth and Planetary Sciences Letters called: "Deciphering past earthquakes from paleoseismic records – The Paleoseismic EArthquake CHronologies (PEACH) code".

Authors: Octavi Gómez-Novell, Bruno Pace, Francesco Visini, Joanna Faure Walker and Oona Scotti.

Funding: This work has been supported by two consecutive postdoctoral grants awarded to Octavi Gómez-Novell in 2022: “Borsa di studio n. 2341/2021” funded by the INGEO Department (Università degli Studi “G. d’Annunzio” di Chieti e Pescara) and “Margarita Salas grant” funded by the University of Barcelona with EU’s “Next Generation” funds.
